<!--HTML INTRO -->
<!--What is an HTML Element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>-->

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>


<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

<!--HTML Elements-->


<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

Examples of some HTML elements:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

Nested HTML Elements
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):

    <body>

        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>
        
     </body>

     <h1>My First Heading</h1>
     <p>My first paragraph.</p>



<!--HTML Attributes-->

HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a> href in this case is attribute

<img src="img_girl.jpg"> src is att

<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">


The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.



<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. 


<!--HTML Headings-->


HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.



    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

For example:

<h1> - Page title
<h2> - Section titles
<h3> - Sub-sections

    <h1>Travel Guide</h1>

<h2>Europe</h2>
<h3>France</h3>
<h3>Italy</h3>

<h2>Asia</h2>
<h3>India</h3>
<h3>Thailand</h3>

<!--HTML Paragraphs-->

The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.

    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>

    <p>
        This paragraph
        contains a lot of lines
        in the source code,
        but the browser
        ignores it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This paragraph
        contains         a lot of spaces
        in the source         code,
        but the        browser
        ignores it.
        </p>

        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>


The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.



    <pre>
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
      
        My Bonnie lies over the sea.
      
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
      
        Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
      </pre>

<!--HTML Quotation and Citation Elements-->

In this chapter we will go through the <blockquote>,<q>, <abbr>, <address>, <cite>, and <bdo> HTML elements.


    The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.

        Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.

            <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.
</blockquote>
The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.


    <p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>
    The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM
        <p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>

        The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
            <address>
                Written by John Doe.<br>
                Visit us at:<br>
                Example.com<br>
                Box 564, Disneyland<br>
                USA
                </address>





The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work
    <p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edvard Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>


    The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction:
        <bdo dir="rtl">This text will be written from right to left</bdo>


<!--HTML Comments-->

<!-- Write your comments here -->

<!-- This is a comment -->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- Remember to add more information here -->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!--
<p>Look at this cool image:</p>
<img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
-->
<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>
<!--HTML Colors-->
<!--RGB-->
In HTML, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:

rgb(red, green, blue)

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255.

This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors!

For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 0.

Another example, rgb(0, 255, 0) is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 0.

To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).

To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).
<!--HEX-->
Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).

For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 00.

Another example, #00ff00 is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 00.

To display black, set all color parameters to 00, like this: #000000.

To display white, set all color parameters to ff, like this: #ffffff.

<!--HTML HSL and HSLA Colors-->
Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.

Experiment by mixing the HSL values below:


<!--HTML Styles - CSS-->


What is CSS?
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.

An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.

The following example sets the text color of the <h1> element to blue, and the text color of the <p> element to red:

    <h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>

<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 300%;
}
p {
  color: red;
  font-family: courier;
  font-size: 160%;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

p {
    border: 2px solid powderblue;
  }
  p {
    border: 2px solid powderblue;
    padding: 30px;
  }
  p {
    border: 2px solid powderblue;
    margin: 50px;
  }

        a:hover, a:active {
          background-color: red;
        }
        </style>


        <!--HTML Images-->



        The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">

<!--HTML Map-->

Image Maps
The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.

Try to click on the computer, phone, or the cup of coffee in the image below:

The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click.

To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas.
<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">

Then, add a <map> element.

    The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute:
    

        
        <!--HTML Favicon-->
        To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your webserver, or create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image in this folder. A common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico".

        Next, add a <link> element to your "index.html" file, after the <title> element, like this:

            <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Page Title</title>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


<!--HTML Page Title-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>HTML Tutorial</title>
</head>
<body>

The content of the document......

</body>
</html>


What is a Good Title?
The title should describe the content and the meaning of the page.

The page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO). The text is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

The <title> element:

defines a title in the browser toolbar
provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
displays a title for the page in search engine-results
So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!

<!--HTML Block and Inline Elements-->
Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

The two most common display values are block and inline.

A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.



    <!--HTML Div Element-->


    The <div> element is used as a container for other HTML elements.

        The <div> Element
            The <div> element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after.
            

                Lorem Ipsum <div>I am a div</div> dolor sit amet.

                The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

                    <div>
                        <h2>London</h2>
                        <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
                        <p>London has over 9 million inhabitants.</p>
                      </div>


<!--HTML class Attribute-->
The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.

Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="city">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Paris</h2>
  <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Tokyo</h2>
  <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>

<h2 class="city main">London</h2>
<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>

<!--HTML id Attribute-->


The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.

You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#myHeader {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: black;
  padding: 40px;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>

</body>
</html>


<style>
    /* Style the element with the id "myHeader" */
    #myHeader {
      background-color: lightblue;
      color: black;
      padding: 40px;
      text-align: center;
    }
    
    /* Style all elements with the class name "city" */
    .city {
      background-color: tomato;
      color: white;
      padding: 10px;
    }
    </style>
    
    <!-- An element with a unique id -->
    <h1 id="myHeader">My Cities</h1>
    
    <!-- Multiple elements with same class -->
    <h2 class="city">London</h2>
    <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
    
    <h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
    <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
    
    <h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
    <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
